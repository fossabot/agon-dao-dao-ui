[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FAgon-Protocol%2Fagon-dao-dao-ui.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FAgon-Protocol%2Fagon-dao-dao-ui?ref=badge_shield)


This project creates a web UI around the [DAO DAO V1 smart contracts](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/dao-contracts). Enabling users to:

- Create a governance token based DAO or multisig
- View proposals and treasury info
- Easily create proposals
- Vote on proposals

All without having to code!

You can find more info in our [documentation](https://docs.daodao.zone). Join the [DAO DAO Discord](https://discord.gg/sAaGuyW3D2) if you're interested in becoming a contributor.
