// Adapters need to be loaded lazily like this, as opposed to just defining a
// global array, due to cyclic dependencies. The adapter defintion files include
// components, which include the react folder index, which includes the provider
// file, which includes the core because it uses the matching helpers below,
// which depend on this adapter list. The fix is that no internal components
// should have a dependency chain that leads back to the matching functions
// below, except the react provider, which we should only be used externally.
// This is a problem to solve later.
